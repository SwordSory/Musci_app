# Music_app (First Update)
App that allows you to play music.

"pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the dependencies
ALSO USE VENV


It is still a work in progress.
I plan to make it possible to download music from the app.
For now you need to download music to the Songs folder. The Songs folder is automatically created when you run the file for the first time.
Also any file that is not a mp3 that is in the Songs folder when the program is running will be deleted.

You can also create a exe file with pyinstaller:- pyinstaller --onefile --windowed shuffler.py



Also you can download music from youtube by replacing youtube.com in youtube url with youtubepp.com and selecting audio [FOR NOW] until I add download feature in the app.

Also dont mind the UI it is still a work in progress.
I will post updated version after updating it.
