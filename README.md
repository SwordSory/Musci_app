# Music_app
App that allows you to play music.


It is still a work in progress.
I plan to make it possible to download music from the app.
For now you need to download music to the folder where the file is located. 

You can also create a exe file with pyinstaller:- pyinstaller --onefile --windowed shuffler.py

Also dont remove the other files and can just add music in the same folder. It ignores other files and only reads mp3 files to play.

Also you can download music from youtube by replacing youtube.com in youtube url with youtubepp.com and selecting audio [FOR NOW] until I add download feature in the app.

Also dont mind the UI it is still a work in progress.
I will post updated version after completing it.
