# Music_app
App that allows you to play music.


It is still a work in progress.
I plan to make it possible to download music from the app.
For now you need to download music to the folder where the file is located. 

You can also create a exe file with pyinstaller:- pyinstaller --onefile --windowed shuffler.py

Also dont remove the other files and can just add music in the same folder. It ignores other files and only reads mp3 files to play.
